# gdb2gpkg
Plugin for QGIS that copy all feature classes from a geodatabase to an empty geopackage

The main action use the accepted answer to [this question](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/372385/converting-an-esri-gdb-to-gpkg-using-pyqgis).

The idea is to have a friendly user interface in order to specify the source geodatabase and the destination geopackage filename.
Once selected, click the "Go" button and wait for the feature classes to be copied.
